# CBIR_with_images_deciphers
Content-Based Image Retrieval System using multiple image deciphers for feature extraction

this is the first step of a larger project to simulate a search engine with larger images dataset, where we will design a testing enviroment for each image decipher and report our results.
this current version provide the ability to:

1- index all images with the algorithm of choice
2- query the indexies for a matching image


image deciphers utilized:
